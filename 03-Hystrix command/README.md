# Vulcain hystrix commands

Vulcain implements hystrix command and provides the same functionalities.

See [hystrix wiki](https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/wiki/Configuration) for more informations.

> Due to the mono thread node context, hystrix thread functionalities are ignored (and ```Collapser``` too).
